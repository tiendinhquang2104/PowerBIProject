This is my personal project aimed at analyzing the graduation scores of students from the UEH university

## Project Objectives:

- To compare the correlation between the two graduation periods in 2024
- To evaluate key factors such as the number of students graduating with distinction or excellence, average scores, highest and lowest scores across each graduation period.
- To analyze the number of graduates by major
- To identify trends and patterns in student performance across different graduation periods and majors
- To uncover potential disparities or areas of improvement in academic performance
- To provide insights for university management to enhance student support programs and curriculum design.
These analyses aim to address questions such as:

- Are there significant differences in academic performance between the two graduation periods?
- Which majors consistently produce high-achieving graduates, and - which may need further academic support?
- How can the university optimize its resources to improve student outcomes and graduation rates?
## Project Detail 
The data for this project was obtained from the official publication platform of the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH). Specifically, it comprises two PDF files:

<sup>ueh_graduating_score_overview_Dot3_2024.pdf</sup>

<sup>ueh_graduating_score_overview_Dot4_2024.pdf</sup>




These files contain comprehensive information about the graduation scores of students for the third and fourth graduation periods of 2024, including data on the number of graduates, their academic performance, and their majors
